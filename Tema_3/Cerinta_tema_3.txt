Kristen is a contender for valedictorian of her high school. She wants to know how many students (if any) have scored higher than her in the 
exams given during this semester.

Create a class named 'Student' with the following specifications:
 - An instance variable named 'scores' to hold a student's exam scores.
 - A void input() function that reads 5 floats and saves them to 'scores'.
 - An float calculateTotalScore() function that returns the sum of the student's scores.

Constraints:
 -> 1<= n <=100, where n is number of the students;
 -> 0<= s <= 50, where s is the exam's score; 
 -> the first line of the n students contains the scores of Kristen. 

Exemple

Input:

n=3 
vector[0]= 30 40 45 10 10
vector[1]= 40 40 40 10 10
vector[2]= 50 20 30 10 10
